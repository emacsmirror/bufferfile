## Introduction

This package provides helper functions to delete, rename, or copy buffer files:
- `bufferfile-rename`: Renames the file visited by the current buffer and updates the buffer name for all associated buffers, including clones/indirect buffers. It also ensures that buffer-local features referencing the file, such as Eglot or dired buffers, are correctly updated to reflect the new file name.
- `bufferfile-delete`: Delete the file associated with a buffer and kill all buffers visiting the file, including clones/indirect buffers.
- `bufferfile-copy`: Copies the file visited by the current buffer to a new file.

The functions above also ensures that any modified buffers are saved prior to executing operations like renaming, deleting, or copying.

(To make *bufferfile* use version control when renaming or deleting files, you can set the variable `bufferfile-use-vc` to t. This ensures that file operations within *bufferfile* interact with the version control system, preserving history and tracking changes properly.)

## Installation from MELPA

To install *bufferfile* from MELPA:

1. If you haven't already done so, [add MELPA repository to your Emacs configuration](https://melpa.org/#/getting-started).

2. Add the following code to your Emacs init file to install *bufferfile* from MELPA:
```emacs-lisp
(use-package bufferfile
  :ensure t
  :custom
  ;; If non-nil, display messages during file renaming operations
  (bufferfile-verbose nil)

  ;; If non-nil, enable using version control (VC) when available
  (bufferfile-use-vc nil)

  ;; Specifies the action taken after deleting a file and killing its buffer.
  (bufferfile-delete-switch-to 'parent-directory))
```

## Usage

- To rename the current buffer's file and associated buffers, run: `M-x bufferfile-rename`
  (You will be prompted to enter a new name. The file will be renamed on disk, and the buffer—along with any associated buffers such as indirect buffers—will begin visiting the new file, with their buffer names updated accordingly.)

- To delete the current buffer's file and associated buffers, run: `M-x bufferfile-delete`
  (You will be asked to confirm the deletion. If confirmed, the file will be removed from disk, and all associated buffers, including indirect buffers, will be killed.)

- To copy the current buffer's file, run: `M-x bufferfile-copy`

## Customizations

### How to make Dired use bufferfile to rename files

By default, Dired's rename operation (`R`) updates the file on disk but may not correctly update any buffers visiting the file, especially for renamed files with indirect (clone) buffers.

To address this, you can override Dired's rename keybinding (`R`) to use `bufferfile-dired-do-rename`, which uses bufferfile rename functions. This ensures that all associated buffers, including indirect ones, are properly updated after the rename operation:

```elisp
;; Override Dired's rename behavior to use bufferfile rename functions,
;; ensuring buffers visiting the renamed file are updated accordingly.
(with-eval-after-load 'dired
  (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "R") #'bufferfile-dired-do-rename))
```

### Making bufferfile use version control (VC), such as Git, when renaming or deleting files?

To make *bufferfile* use version control (VC) when renaming or deleting files, you can set the variable `bufferfile-use-vc` to `t`. This ensures that file operations within *bufferfile* interact with the version control system, preserving history and tracking changes properly.

``` emacs-lisp
(setq bufferfile-use-vc t)
```

### Usage

### Hook functions

The *bufferfile* package provides customizable hook variables that allow users to execute functions before and after renaming or deleting files. These hooks can be used to integrate additional logic, such as logging, or updating dependent buffers.

#### Hooks for Renaming Files

- **`bufferfile-pre-rename-functions`**
  A list of functions executed before renaming a file.
  Each function receives three arguments:
  - `previous-path`: The original file path.
  - `new-path`: The new file path.
  - `list-buffers`: The list of buffers associated with the file.

- **`bufferfile-post-rename-functions`**
  A list of functions executed after a file has been renamed.
  Each function receives the same three arguments as `bufferfile-pre-rename-functions`.

#### Hooks for Deleting Files

- **`bufferfile-pre-delete-functions`**
  A list of functions executed before a file is deleted.
  Each function receives two arguments:
  - `path`: The file path to be deleted.
  - `list-buffers`: The list of buffers associated with the file.

- **`bufferfile-post-delete-functions`**
  A list of functions executed after a file has been deleted.
  Each function receives the same two arguments as `bufferfile-pre-delete-functions`.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is the difference between bufferfile and the built-in Emacs rename and delete functions?

Here are the limitations of Emacs' built-in functions:

- Renaming: Indirect buffers point to the correct file path, but their buffer names become outdated.
- Deleting: Indirect buffers are not removed when the base buffer or another indirect buffer is deleted.

**The bufferfile package addresses these issues** by ensuring that buffer names are updated when renaming a file and that all buffers, including indirect buffers, are deleted when a file is removed.

These limitations of the built-in functions motivated the development of *bufferfile*, which improves support for renaming and deleting buffers, including indirect buffers.

Thank you for this package!
